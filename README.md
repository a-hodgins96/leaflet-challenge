# leaflet-challenge

PART 1

This challenge was to create a Equake Visualisaton using a dataset from USGS GeoJSON's feed. Then pulling the data from the JSON and creating a a visual representation of that data using leaflet. 
Included in this task was using leaflet to plot all the earthquakes from the data set based on their lonitude and lattitude, with each marker reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by the size and depth of colour.
